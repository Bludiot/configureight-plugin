# Configure 8 Color Scheme Styles

The color scheme stylesheets use the CSS variable values implemented in theme stylesheets. They are based on 16 named colors per scheme, eight for light mode and eight for dark mode. Some schemes require overriding the default color assignments, particularly when used in the Configure 8 admin theme.
